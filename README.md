🦕 The Natural me: I love music, I play the Piano, Guitar, currently learning to play the Bass and the Violin. I occasionally write music(mostly just riffs). If you're a musician and would like to write music with me, please [reach out](https://www.bandlab.com/dannydanny19). I also love Formula one and Football (one that we play with our feet duh~).
